## Optional Macros

These are macros you can define before including GAL in your project to alter its behavior.

`GAL_ERROR_LOGGING`: Allow GAL to log runtime errors to cerr, even if the exception is caught.\
`GAL_WARNING_LOGGING`: Allow GAL to log warnings for non-fatal errors to cerr (don't know what this will be used for
yet).\
`GAL_INFO_LOGGING`: Allow GAL to log verbose info about everything it's doing to cout for debugging purposes.\
`GAL_VERBOSE`: Defines all the above logging macros.
